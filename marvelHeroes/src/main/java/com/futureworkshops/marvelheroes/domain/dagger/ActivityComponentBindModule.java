 * Created by dimitrios on 24/08/2017.
 *
 * This Module's purpose, is to define which Activity depends on which Module.
 * By providing this Module to our {@link AppComponent}
 * we are allowing Dagger to generate SubComponents and inject our activities.
 * The benefit of this approach, is we don't have to define Dagger Components for our Modules, with
 * the exception of our top-level AppComponent.
 * Subcomponents are components that live below the AppComponent in our graph.
