/**
 * Created by dimitris on 15/09/2017.
 * <p>
 * This is an example of the alternative way of defining subcomponents... of defining the mapping of subcomponents
 * to our Dagger dependency graph manually.
 * <p>
 * As we always do when we want to inject dependencies in a new Activity/Fragment/Class... we define a Module.
 * In our case {@link MoviesModule} Then, as we saw in our
 * {@link com.futureworkshops.android.architecture.presentation.login.dagger.LoginModule} example, we can go into
 * {@link com.futureworkshops.android.architecture.domain.dagger.module.ActivityComponentBindModule}
 * and define a mapping between our Android Framework class (e.g. Activity) and our Module by using
 * {@link dagger.android.ContributesAndroidInjector}.
 * Then Dagger takes care of the rest for us and generates a subcomponent and adds it to our graph below the
 * top-level Component.
 * <p>
 * The only reason I can think of to NOT follow the above approach and manually define that mapping ourselves, as we do
 * in this class, is to better understand how Dagger works... otherwise I can see no further advantage of this approach.
 * <p>
 * In this class, we define an Abstract module, that binds our {@link MoviesActivity} to our {@link MoviesSubcomponent}.
 * By including this binding-module to the list of modules defined in our
 * {@link com.futureworkshops.android.architecture.domain.dagger.AppComponent} the subcomponent will be added to the
 * dependency graph.
