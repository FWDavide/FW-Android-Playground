 * This is a Dagger module. We use this to bind our Application class as a Context in the AppComponent
 * By using Dagger Android we do not need to pass our Application instance to any module,
 * we simply need to expose our Application as Context.
 * One of the advantages of Dagger.Android is that your
 * Application & Activities are provided into your graph for you.
